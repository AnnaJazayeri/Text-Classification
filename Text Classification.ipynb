The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Notably, the class AIMX exhibits perfect precision but lower recall, indicating that while the model correctly identifies instances of AIMX, it may miss some. The class BASE has undefined precision, possibly due to no true positive predictions, highlighting a limitation. Similarly, the classes CONT and MISC have undefined precision and recall for certain metrics, possibly due to no true positive or true negative predictions. On the other hand, the class OWNX demonstrates strong precision, recall, and F1-score, suggesting robust performance in identifying instances of OWNX. The overall macro-average and weighted-average metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across all classes, with a weighted average F1-score of 0.81, showcasing a reasonably effective text classification outcome.\n",

    "    **RESULT** The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 73% on the labeled dataset, its accuracy is less than Naive Bayes classifier. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provide a detailed evaluation of the classifier's performance for each class. Notably, the class 'AIMX' exhibits a precision of 67%, indicating that among the instances predicted as 'AIMX,' 67% are true positive. However, the recall for 'AIMX' is relatively low at 33%, suggesting that only 33% of actual 'AIMX' instances were correctly identified by the classifier. The 'MISC' class demonstrates strong performance with a precision of 69%, recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 82%, indicating a well-balanced classification for this category. It's important to note that some classes, such as 'BASE' and 'CONT,' show undefined precision and F1-score due to zero true positive predictions, indicating potential challenges in correctly identifying these classes. Overall, the classifier exhibits reasonable performance, but further tuning and exploration may be beneficial to enhance results, especially for classes with limited instances."

    "    **RESULT** The Random Forest classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 67% on the labeled dataset, its accuracy is less than SVM classifier and Naive Bayes classifier. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provide insights into the classifier's performance for each class. The 'AIMX' class exhibits a precision of 60%, indicating that 60% of instances predicted as 'AIMX' are true positives. However, the recall for 'AIMX' is 50%, suggesting that only 50% of actual 'AIMX' instances were correctly identified by the classifier. The 'MISC' class shows relatively balanced precision (68%) and recall (96%), resulting in a commendable F1-score of 80%, indicating a robust classification for this category. Notably, some classes, such as 'BASE' and 'CONT,' exhibit undefined precision and F1-score, reflecting challenges in correctly identifying these classes. The classifier demonstrates moderate overall performance, and further parameter tuning or exploration of alternative classifiers may enhance specific class predictions."
